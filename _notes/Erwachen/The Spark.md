*In the heart of the bold, a flame ignites, A power unseen, that fuels the fights.

*Warriors strong with steel in hand, Stronger still, with the Spark at their command.*

*The Spark, a light both hidden and rare, It chooses the few with courage to dare. A gift of the fates, a mystical force, Guiding the chosen on their heroic course.*

Each spark is a balance between the schools of magic:
	- Primalism
	- Miraclework
	- Sorcery
	- Wizardry
	- Occultism
	- Psychics
Each spark also has a Potency.

## Primalism
This is the power within. Most primalists move faster and punch harder. Many make raw blasts of kinetic energy in the air. Certain primalists enhance their instincts.

## Miraclework
The power of faith. The miracleworker might cure a disease, light your way in the dark, or remain unharmed when burned on a pyre.

## Sorcery
The power of the arcane. A sorcerer knows incantations gestures and rituals. Enough to cast an elaborate spell, and change the circumstances of their surroundings wildly.

## Wizardry
The power of tools and implements. A wizard uses magical objects and tools to achieve predetermined effects. They might carry a staff or wand that shoots precise and powerful darts of fire. They might be the proud owner of a magic helmet that let you see people's soul. This is the only type of magic available to those without the spark, but *with* the spark, you become a True Wizard. True Wizardry is the art of weaving one's own power into the effects of an implement. It can be tremendously powerful.

## Occultism
The power that lies beyond mortal ken. These are abilities taught by demons, or angels or something else entirely. The teacher doesn't power the abilities, the users own spark does, but the abilities cannot be taught by mortals. The witch who summoned a devil for magic is an Occultist, as is the shaman that petition living spirits for favors.

## Psychic
The power of the mind. The psychic expert can send telepathic messages across great lengths. They can dominate the will of others. They may see what is unseen, or hear what has no sound.

## Oath of the Quester
In the temple of Justicars, young knights may take the Oath of the Quester and swear to serve the church for life. This has sometimes inspired the spark to light up. 

Some take the oath specifically hoping that the spark will come alive, but for such young knights it usually doesn't. 

Instead, the knights that truly make the Oath out of a desire to be a holy Quester for life regularly light their spark in the moment of inspiration when they take their Oath. These few knights are called Paladins.

## A Village in Flames
In the outer regions of the Goldspiran plains there lies a village called Shimmerleaf. This village is ablaze, as bandits have torched the place and is currently rounding up villagers for slavery. 

A young lad prays that the stories of the spark are true. He takes up a kitchen knife and storms the bandit leader, imagining that his heroic story starts here!

It doesn't. The lad hadn't committed to attacking the bandits with his own power, instead praying for the spark to win the day for him... He falls to the blade.

His mother's mind goes blank, and the animalistic fury of vengeance blinds her as she charges that same bandit leader. As her spark lights up, her hand changes and morphs into wicked claws. Her legs grow and mutate. She powerfully leaps at the bandits, tearing the leaders throat out with her unnatural hands and she turns to rip and tear into the now fleeing bandits.

## The Mission of Eccothief
In a town near the metropolis of Solevidom, a young man works diligently, installing a winch in a well. Then an army of mighty demons invade, slaughtering all in their path. The mighty warlord from hell wielding a wicked blade stabs the young man in the chest, but in the moment he should have died, he instead enters a trance far removed from reality.

A voice is there with him in that void. It offers him his life, but in return he must undertake a mission. It is no ordinary sword that pierced the young man's heart, but a powerful sentient weapon. The weapon wishes freedom from this demonic master. 

As the young man accepts, the sword leaves a mystical metallic splint within his heart. The boy awakens hours later in the ashes of the violent invasion. He has a mighty scar across his chest, and new powers at his fingertips.
