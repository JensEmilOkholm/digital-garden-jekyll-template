# The Captain's Hat
Dean wants to steal an iconic hat, that a local bandit called the Captain always struts around with.

The Captain has put his hat down by a table, and he sleeps in a chair next to it. A henchman of his is counting coins by a table in the same room.

If not for the henchman, this would have only been Risky, but sneaking in there while someone is awake is frankly Perilous. He gets Standard Effect.

Dean will be told his Position and Effect, and he may choose to reconsider. If he wants to go ahead, he will be asked to roll Guile.

Failing will mean he gets caught red-handed.

Accomplishing will mean he gets the hat, but some complication occur. The GM might decide what, or perhaps offer the player a choice. Maybe the henchman hears Dean as he exits the room. The henchman wont know who dunnit, but a chase will start. Alternatively, the henchman might not realise anything bad happening, but Dean will leave behind evidence that gives away their identity.

Excelling means Dean snatches the hat without anyone being the wiser.

If Dean is a [[Burglar]], then he should factor in Go Incognito and Unnoticed from their playbook. This will net them a great [[Effect]] instead of standard. Perhaps that means they get to snatch some goodies of the henchmans coin-counting table as well.

*Either way, it is important that the GM and the Player works together to describe how the outcome comes about!*
