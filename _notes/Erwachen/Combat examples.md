# The Mountain Goat
Player has a Formidability of 4. They have a sword, and they are fighting a Mountain Goat with a Formidability of 3. Since they’re ahead, they can choose to make their Position safer, from Perilous to Risky, or they can increase their own Effect from Standard to Great.

GM: Before you stand a mountain goat, stocky and powerful. It has thick horns and could bullrush you right off the cliff! What’s your Formidability?

Player: Well I am wearing rags, but I have a proper iron sword and my base is 2, so 4?

GM: You are more Formidable than the goat then, you can make your position Risky rather than Perilous, or increase your Effect to Great.

Player: Time is of the essence, my crew waits for me to get to the detonator!

GM: It sounds like you want to risk the higher Effect, so that you may proceed faster. Then roll Force!

Player: Indeed! _MATH ROCKS, GO!_ That’s an 8 chief.

GM: Well, you’ll kill the goat, but there will be consequences for your recklessness. Let’s see, would you rather you were pushed down the cliff, delaying your progress but taking only light damage, or would you rather the goat gets you real good, but you stay up on the cliffs?

Player: Like I said… time is of the essence. I will take full damage to stay up here.

GM: 4 damage it is then!

*And then the GM and the player together dramatically describe this wild encounter where the goat managed to almost wound Player, running them down, but was ultimately slain, and then Player went on with their mission. Since Player had a Damage Threshold of 5, they weren’t seriously wounded, but their luck is used up. They must take care now, lest they get a Wound. The player was also given a choice, to delay their progress. In that case they may have instead only taken 2 damage.*

# The Fearsome Bandit
Player has a Formidability of 3, since they have a sling, and is fighting a bandit in the woods. The Bandit has a Formidability of 4 using a woodchopper’s axe and wearing lightly protective armor. Normally, this would mean that Player is having a Limited Effect and a Perilous Position.

The GM rules, that the bandit is too far away and without any ranged attacks, thus lowering the Player’s Position to Safe, until the bandit manages to close the distance. This is powerful, but recall that a sling doesn’t grant any Formidability in close range, so if the bandit manages to close the distance, our Player will be in serious danger!

GM: The bandit looks serious. He is wearing scraps of iron tied together to form light protection, and he has a brutal looking axe with him! You do not feel confident you can fight him, but he is a ways away.

Player: I _could_ run, but that would botch the whole operation… I’ll have to try and get him while he is way over there! I use my sling! I have a Formidability score of 3.

GM: Well you’ll have Limited Effect, but you’re safe so long as he is so far away. Distant Assail it is, roll Expertise for me!

Player: I feel like he is definitely going to come over here, then I’ll be screwed as he has high Formidability… I roll… 10!

GM: Right, I’ll give you either full damage, or a temporary advantage. He is going to reach you, do you want to start ahead in the damage department, or do you want him to suffer a penalty to his Formidability?

Player: Hmm, that’s a tough one. If I deal full damage, I would have to try and run away from him and find another way to deal the rest of the needed damage because I can’t possibly fight him when he gets here… Maybe I could set some trap, assuming I can outrun him first… Alternatively, I can decide I _do_ want to fight him, and give him a penalty. Ugh, fine, penalty it is!

GM: The Bandit will reach you but you’ve broken a finger on his good arm, and his fighting is now a little more clumsy.

Player: I throw the sling away and pick up the Axe that Jon left me! This gives me 3 Formidability in close range!

GM: Then you’re on equal footing now! He has better gear, but his hand is damaged, lowering his formidability to 3.

*The GM and the player determines the next roll, and resolve it. Then they dramatically describe the action of the scene together. If not for the fact that the player knew they had an Axe to fall back on, they might’ve instead picked to deal as high a damage number as possible to push the bandit close to their Damage Threshold. This way, they could have possibly been able to take them out without close fighting.*
