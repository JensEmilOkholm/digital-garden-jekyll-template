Increase the Effect by 1.

If, for instance, you attempt to cross a river with a serious undercurrent, you may succeed with Limited Effect, getting to the other side but ending up a good way downstream. With this trait, you would instead gain Standard Effect and be able to cross the stream where you meant to.

If the Effect is already Great, then add +1 to your roll instead.
