```--- title: Educated Climber ---```

Increase the Effect by 1.

If, for instance, you attempt to scale a sheer cliff, you might succeed with Limited Effect, making it to the top but having to leave your backpack behind. With this trait, you would instead gain Standard Effect, being able to scale the cliff without leaving your backpack behind.

If the Effect is already Great, then add +1 to your roll instead.
