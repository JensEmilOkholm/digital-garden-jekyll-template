```--- title: Formidability ---```

A character’s Formidability score is used to determine their base Position and Effect when fighting. The Position and Effect can be affected circumstantially, and this can be more important than a characters Formidability, in some cases.

If a character has the same Formidability as their enemy, they fight at a Perilous Position, to a Standard Effect.

When one is ahead of the other, they may affect the player’s Effect and Position as such:

- If you are one point ahead, your Effect becomes Great, **or** your Position becomes Risky.
    
- If you are two points ahead, your Effect becomes Great, **and** your Position becomes Risky.
    
- If you are three points ahead, your Effect becomes Great, and your Position becomes Safe. There is normally no need to roll dice, if you are three points ahead.
    
- If you are one point behind, your Effect becomes Limited, while your Position remains Perilous.
    
- If you are two points behind, your Effect becomes None, and your Position remains Perilous.
    

All Characters have a starting Formidability of 2.

A primitive weapon will typically give +1 Formidability, while a proper weapon gives +2. Light armor will also give +1, while heavy armor gives +2.

Being proficient with your weapon, yields another +1, and an expert with their weapon may add +2.

Those with the Spark may use the action Flare of Power, to take 3 Inner Fire in order to raise their Formidability for a Scene.
