Safe - There is no real consequence for failure.

Risky - There is some form of consequence for failure, but you could salvage the outcome… You might not escape without some Damage or a flare of Inner Fire. (1-3 points).

Perilous - Failure is dangerous. You risk raking some serious Damage, or burst your Inner Fire. (3+ points).

Keep in mind that the consequences for failure doesn’t always have to be damage…
