When you Help a Friend, you must describe how it is possible and how you do it.

You then check your level of trust towards the player in question, 0, 1, or 2. If you have:

0 - Make a roll+relevant Attribute Score. On a succes, your ally gain +1 to their roll. A partial success counts, and the complication is minor.

1 - Your ally simply gets +1 to their roll.

2 - Your ally simply gets +2 to their roll.
