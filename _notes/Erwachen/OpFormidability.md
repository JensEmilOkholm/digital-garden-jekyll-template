```--- title: OpFormidability ---```

When players engage in violent confrontations, they compare their Formidability with that of their opponents. This means the GM must determine the Oppositions Formidability, or OPFOR. As a rule of thumb for humanoid enemies, OPFOR can be determined in a similar way that normal players determine theirs.

Most opposition has a starting Formidability of 2.

A primitive weapon will typically give +1 Formidability, while a proper weapon gives +2. Light armor will also give +1, while heavy armor gives +2.

Being proficient with your weapon, yields another +1, and an expert with their weapon may add +2.

Those with the Spark may use the action Flare of Power, to take 3 Inner Fire in order to raise their Formidability for a Scene.

This means that a dangerous orcish warrior armed to the teeth may well be formidability 6. They have weapons, light armor and they know how to use those blades. 
2 (from base) + 2 (from armed) + 1 (from armor) + 1 (from proficient) = 6

It is to be noted that a GM needs no excuse to give enemies a penalty or bonus, if they feel it is better for the narrative.

When opposition team up, use this procedure to find their OPFOR.
- Take the most Formidable member, as base Formidability.
- Determinde if the opposition are Horde, Normal or Elite monsters.
	- Horde monsters add 1 per team-up
	- Normal monsters add 2 per team-up
	- Elite monsters add 3 per team-up

## Examples
Billy's player character Bref is a tall knight with the spark. He wears heavy armor, has a beautiful steel sword and he knows how to use it.  This means that Bref normally fights with a Formidability of 7. Bref has Empowered Fighting, as his spark leans into Primalism. This gives him a Formidability of 8. If he really needs to, he might use Flare of Power and briefly gain another Formidability so that he has 9.

A pseudo-goblin might be 2 in base, + 1 for the shovel-axe it is waving around over its head. This makes it a monster with an OPFOR of 3. It is not very dangerous on its own, given that the players have swords and know how they work. However, if it is joined by 4 of its mates, the OPFOR becomes 3 + 4 = 7. These are an even match for Bref the Knight, even without his Empowered Fighting.

A goblin foot-soldier then might have a scrap-metal sword and something resembling armor armor. The GM determines that they would rather run the goblins as Formidability 4, even though strictly the math says 5. This is because the players should feel that these soldiers are a form of cannon-fodder. The GM doesn't need any excuse to do this, but if they want to justify themselves they can always say that the soldiers education in swordplay is lackluster and that the weapon is more improvised than anything. Perhaps that weapon is rusty or dull. If the goblin foot-soldier is joined by 2 of its mates, the math becomes 4 + 4 = 8, meaning 3 of these together pose a much greater threat. These are an even match for Bref with his Empowered Fighting.

Similarly, that orcish warrior with an OPFOR of 6, when joined by a single mate, gets a total OPFOR of 9. These tall and skillful warriors are to be taken serious indeed. These are an even match if Bref uses Flare of Power for a momentary increase in Formidability.
