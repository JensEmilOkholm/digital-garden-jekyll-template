Permanent scars left on your physical body. Once a scar is gained, an attribute point must be moved from one attribute to another, and the player must specify why.

A player who has 3 scars and must gain another is permanently taken out of the game. This may be seen as death or otherwise irrevocably indisposed.

Example: a player could pick up a limp that decreases their Prowess by one. But what they lost in Force, they gained in Guile because their take-away lesson was to approach a problem with misdirection instead of head-on.
