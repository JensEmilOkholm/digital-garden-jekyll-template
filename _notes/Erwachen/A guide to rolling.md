```--- title: A guide to rolling ---```

When you are asked to roll+[[Core Attribute Score]], you roll 2d6 and add the value of your score.

You will be given a [[Position]] and an [[Effect]]. All outcomes will be seen in light of your [[Position]] and [[Effect]].

Your result is:  
1-6: You fail to accomplish what you meant to. Unless the [[Position]] was Safe, expect something unfavourable to happen. This is called Fail.

7-9: You accomplish what you meant to, but some complications occur. This is called Accomplish.

10+: You get the best possible results. Note that your [[Effect]] informs what the best _possible_ result is. This is called Excel.
