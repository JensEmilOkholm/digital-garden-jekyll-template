[[Damage Threshold]] +1  
[[Inner fire Threshold]] -1

Once per phase, when you pass your [[Damage Threshold]], you instead take enough [[Damage]] to be one point from Threshold.

Your dwarven nose allows you to rely on your sense of smell at an increased level of [[Effect]].

_In their homes under the mountains, Dwarves mine for precious resources, built industrious solutions to their strange living terms, and have a lifespan that exceeds that of men and elves. The typical dwarf may live nearly two centuries. They warred with deeplings long before mankind did, though of course, none do now._
