_Evolved to live only in the deepest parts of the underground pockets of existence, this people has grey, cold skin, long ears and large eyes that adapt to either the faintest of light, or the infrared spectrum. When dwarves first ran afoul of Deeplings, they warred. When Deeplings eventually took to the surface around mountainous exits from their deep dwellings, they met mankind, and warred._

_Eventually they warred on no-one, for they are a peaceful people. Past conflicts were only in self defense, necessitated by their appearance, which is alien, and uncanny._
