Mortal fear: Elves are as mortal as men, yet death is alien and terrifying to them. Elves have -1 to resist fear.

_Legends say that Elves were once immortal. Perhaps that explains why their instinctual minds cannot fathom the concept of death. All Elves must deal with a subconscious mind that reject the notion of death fundamentallyâ€¦ Elves live in their veiled forest cities across the realms._
