+2 Vigil  
+1 Heart

## Conduct an Inquisition
Any time you try to acquire hidden information, you gain +1 Effect.

For instance, if you’re using your senses to see whether someone is lying, it might normally be to Limited, or even None Effect if they’re good at it. With this, you would get Standard, or at least Limited Effect.

## Equipment
Everyone has, and does not need to spend an equipment point on:

- A bedroll that keeps you warm _enough_ provided it isn't Cold Weather.
    
- A square tin for cooking.
    
- A waterskin.
    
- Inexpensive clothes which you may describe.
    
- A sack to hold light weight found objects as well as further equipment.
    

During a Quest or Calm Phase, players may spend their Equipment Points on:

- Fishing rod with wire.
    
- Bolt and tackle, for hoisting.
    
- Rope.
    
- Crowbar.
    
- Practical non-descript knife.
    
- A clumsy mining tool, such as a pickaxe, a bucket, or a hammer.
    

As a Heretic, you may also spend Equipment Points on:

- A handful of sleeping powder to blow in someone's face!
    
- A profane fetish, or unholy symbol. It will scare the god-fearing or earn you the respect of those who reject the common pantheon.
    
- A musical instrument, and you know how to play it too!
