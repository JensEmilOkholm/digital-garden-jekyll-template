```--- title: Poacher ---```

+2 Vigil  
+1 Expertise

## Sniff 'em Out
Anytime you're searching for a living being or navigating or tracking, you gain +1 [[Effect]].

For instance, if you attempt to track a monster back to its layer, it might be to Limited [[Effect]], as it doesn’t really leave too many tracks. With this, you would know the hidden little signs to look for, and therefore gain Standard [[Effect]].

## Equipment
Everyone has, and does not need to spend an [[Equipment Points]] on:

- A bedroll that keeps you warm _enough_ provided it isn't Cold Weather.
    
- A square tin for cooking.
    
- A waterskin.
    
- Inexpensive clothes which you may describe.
    
- A sack to hold light weight found objects as well as further equipment.
    

During a Quest or Calm Phase, players may spend their Equipment Points on:

- Fishing rod with wire.
    
- Bolt and tackle, for hoisting.
    
- Rope.
    
- Crowbar.
    
- Practical non-descript knife.
    
- A clumsy mining tool, such as a pickaxe, a bucket, or a hammer.
    

As a Poacher, you may also spend Equipment Points on:

- A skinning knife and tools to extract the valuables of slain foes.
    
- A sling or a bow. In either case, they are of poor make but could still be of use. You have ammo, but you may run out as a Complication. It gives +1 Formidability, but only when you’re at a distance.
    
- A camouflaged cloak, sewn together with leaves and sticks. This cloak is fitted for the season but works poorly indoors.
