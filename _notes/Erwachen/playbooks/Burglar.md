+1 [[Guile]]

## Go Unnoticed and Incognito
When you attempt to remain unnoticed, you get +1 [[Effect]].

If, for instance, you attempt to prowl through a hallway with few hiding spots, it might be Limited [[Effect]] since the hiding conditions are poor. With this, you would really know how to work the shadows and camouflage yourself, gaining Standard [[Effect]]!


## Equipment
Everyone has, and does not need to spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- A bedroll that keeps you warm _enough_ provided it isn't Cold Weather.
    
- A square tin for cooking.
    
- A waterskin.
    
- Inexpensive clothes which you may describe.
    
- A sack to hold light weight found objects as well as further equipment.
    

During a Quest or Calm Phase, players may spend their [[Equipment Points]] on:

- Fishing rod with wire.
    
- Bolt and tackle, for hoisting.
    
- Rope.
    
- Crowbar.
    
- Practical non-descript knife.
    
- A clumsy mining tool, such as a pickaxe, a bucket, or a hammer.
    

As a Burglar, you may also spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- A bandana to obscure one's identity.
    
- Some lockpicks. No lock is safe from the Burglar!
    
- A pinch of flashpowder to throw on the floor.
