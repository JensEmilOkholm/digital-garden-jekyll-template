```--- title: Swindler ---```

+2 Guile  
+1 Heart

## Strike 'em a Deal
Any time you try to sell something, or lie, you gain +1 to Effect.

If you try to sell ore at a higher rate than usually, you might otherwise have gotten Limited Effect, but with this, you might instead have Standard Effect.

## Equipment
Everyone has, and does not need to spend an equipment point on:

- A bedroll that keeps you warm _enough_ provided it isn't Cold Weather.
    
- A square tin for cooking.
    
- A waterskin.
    
- Inexpensive clothes which you may describe.
    
- A sack to hold light weight found objects as well as further equipment.
    

During a Quest or Calm Phase, players may spend their Equipment Points on:

- Fishing rod with wire.
    
- Bolt and tackle, for hoisting.
    
- Rope.
    
- Crowbar.
    
- Practical non-descript knife.
    
- A clumsy mining tool, such as a pickaxe, a bucket, or a hammer.
    

As a Swindler, you may also spend Equipment Points on:

- An alcoholic drink, an attractive piece of leverage, or something to dull the Inner Fire.
    
- A forged document, or seal, that will fool the casual observer.
    
- A valuable-looking but ultimately worthless piece of jewelry.
