```--- title: Bruiser ---```

+2 [[Force]]  
+1 [[Vigil]]

## Brute Force
When using brute force you gain +1 [[Effect]].

If you attempt to lift a shut portcullis, you may have Limited [[Effect]] since youâ€™re supposed to use a mechanism which is outside your reach. With Brute Force, you would gain Standard [[Effect]] instead.

## Equipment
Everyone has, and does not need to spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- A bedroll that keeps you warm _enough_ provided it isn't Cold Weather.
    
- A square tin for cooking.
    
- A waterskin.
    
- Inexpensive clothes which you may describe.
    
- A sack to hold light weight found objects as well as further equipment.
    

During a Quest or Calm Phase, players may spend their [[Equipment Points]] on:

- Fishing rod with wire.
    
- Bolt and tackle, for hoisting.
    
- Rope.
    
- Crowbar.
    
- Practical non-descript knife.
    
- A clumsy mining tool, such as a pickaxe, a bucket, or a hammer.
    

As a Bruiser, you may also spend [[Equipment Points]] on:

- A bandana to obscure one's identity.
    
- A woodchopper's axe. It looks brutal. It probably is, +1 [[Formidability]].
    
- Some bandages. They're mostly clean and can be used for first aid.
