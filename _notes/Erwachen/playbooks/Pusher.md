+2 Heart  
+1 Force

## Say "pretty Please"
Any time you attempt to get someone to _do_ something for you, you get +1 to Effect.

If you need an NPC to guide you somewhere, and you try to Convince or Coerce them, you might've had Limited Effect if they're not already scared of you... With this, you might instead have Standard Effect.

## Equipment
Everyone has, and does not need to spend an equipment point on:

- A bedroll that keeps you warm _enough_ provided it isn't Cold Weather.
    
- A square tin for cooking.
    
- A waterskin.
    
- Inexpensive clothes which you may describe.
    
- A sack to hold light weight found objects as well as further equipment.
    

During a Quest or Calm Phase, players may spend their Equipment Points on:

- Fishing rod with wire.
    
- Bolt and tackle, for hoisting.
    
- Rope.
    
- Crowbar.
    
- Practical non-descript knife.
    
- A clumsy mining tool, such as a pickaxe, a bucket, or a hammer.
    

As a Pusher, you may also spend Equipment Points on:

- An alcoholic drink, as an attractive piece of leverage, or something to dull the Inner Fire.
    
- A woodchopper's axe. It looks brutal. It probably is, +1 Formidability.
    
- A set of clothes that exudes status above your actual position.
